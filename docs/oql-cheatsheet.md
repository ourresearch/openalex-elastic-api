# OQL cheat sheet

**OQL** is the OpenAlex Query Language — a readable way to write any OpenAlex query.
A query reads almost like a sentence: `works where title has (cancer) and year >= (2020)`.
Try one in the **search box on a results page** (paste it in the OQL panel), or hit the
API directly: `https://api.openalex.org/?oql=<your query>`.

> Every example below runs on production today. Counts are live and will drift.

## The shape

```
<entity> where <conditions> [ group by <dims> ] [ sample <n> ]
```

- **entity** — what you get back: `works`, `authors`, `institutions`, `sources`, `funders`, `topics`, …
- **where** — your conditions (skip it for everything: `works`).
- A condition is `<field> <operator> (<value>)`: `year >= (2020)`, `type is (review)`, `title has (cancer)`. The value always sits in `( … )`.

```
works
works where year is (2020)
authors where last known institution is (I136199984 [Harvard University])
```

## Filter on a field — `is`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `works where year is (2020)` | exact match |
| `works where type is (article)` | a single value |
| `works where type is (article or review)` | one of several — join values with `or` |
| `works where citation count >= (100)` | numeric comparison |
| `works where FWCI >= (2.0)` | floats allowed |
| `works where year >= (2019) and year <= (2023)` | a range = two endpoint conditions |
| `works where institution is (I136199984 [Harvard University])` | entities use their OpenAlex ID; the `[name]` is optional and just for reading |
| `works where language is (en)` · `works where SDG is (3)` | closed vocabularies use codes/ids |

The ID is what counts — anything in `[ … ]` is ignored on input and auto-filled as the
entity's name when the query is displayed back to you.

---

## Search text — `has`

Search a text field with **`has`**. Bare words are **stemmed** (so `cancer` also matches
*cancers*); **quotes** turn stemming off for an **exact** match.

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `works where title has (cancer)` | one stemmed word |
| `works where title has (machine learning)` | a phrase — one search unit, ranked by adjacency |
| `works where title has ("climate change")` | **exact** phrase (no stemming) |
| `works where title has ("cat")` | exact single word — excludes *cats* |
| `works where title has (stemmed "genome editing")` | exact-adjacent **but** still stemmed |
| `works where title has ("psoriat*")` | wildcard — **must be quoted**; `*` = any chars, `?` = one char |
| `works where title has (within 3 ("smart", "phone"))` | proximity — terms within N words, any order |
| `works where title/abstract is similar to ("ocean acidification on coral")` | semantic (meaning-based) search |

**Text fields:** `title`, `abstract`, `title/abstract`, `full text`, `raw affiliation`, `byline`.

---

## Combine & nest — `and`, `or`, `( … )`

Join conditions with `and` / `or`. Use parentheses to group; `and` binds tighter than `or`.

```
works where title has (cancer) and year >= (2020)
works where institution is (I136199984) or funder is (F4320332161)
works where title/abstract has ((vape or vaping) and (health or harm))
works where (year < (2000) and title/abstract has ("global warming"))
  or (title/abstract has ("climate change") and year > (2020))
```

---

## Exclude — `not`

Put `not` right before the value you want to exclude.

```
works where country is (not FR)
works where title has (covid) and abstract has (not pediatric)
works where title has (not mouse and cancer)
```

---

## Yes / no flags — `is true` / `is false`

```
works where open access is (true)
works where has DOI is (true)
works where retracted is (true)
```

---

## Citation links — `it cites`, `it's cited by`

Follow the citation edge in either direction — the subject `it` is each work in your
results. Takes `not` and `or` in the value like any other condition. The bare verb
also works as input (`cites (W…)`, `cited by (W…)`); it canonicalizes to the `it` form.

```
works where it cites (W2741809807)                 works whose reference list includes W…
works where it's cited by (W2741809807)            works in W…'s reference list
works where it's related to (W2741809807)          OpenAlex "related works"
works where title has (climate) and it cites (W1767272795 or W2741809807)
```

---

## Group & sample

```
works where year >= (2020) group by topic
works where year >= (2020) group by topic, year
works where year is (2020) sample 500
```

> view (and `?sort=` / `?select=` on the API). OQL describes *which* results, not how
> they're displayed.

## When something's wrong, OQL tells you

OQL never guesses — a query that can't do what it looks like it does is a clear error
**with a fix-it**, never a silent wrong answer.

| You wrote | OQL says |
|---|---|
| `title contains cancer` | `contains` was renamed → use `title has (cancer)` |
| `title has bar*` | wildcards need quotes → `title has ("bar*")` |
| `title has climate change or warming` | wrap the terms → `title has (climate change or warming)` |
| `type is (article review)` | two values need a connective → add `or` between them (or `and` if you mean both) |
| `pub_year is 2020` | unknown field → it's `year` |
